This is a rest_framework based project powered by `Django`.

It consists of the following features:

- Token based authentication and authorization
- Linting based on standard `flake8`

The apps involved in this project are:

- `app` - The root app for the project
- `core` - This app contains all the models, migrations and admin related views
- `user` - An individual app for user based views
